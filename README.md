# Usage summary

ZeroMass is a bottom software layer for web application development in PHP.
It sits right on top of PHP, with zero dependencies, providing an 
application loading mechanism, a hook system and a minimalistic application
execution flow.  It is an unix-philosophy approach to web application 
development, performing a very limited set of features extremely well, and
providing communication points where the next layer of software sits 
_without abstraction leakage_.

Do not let the minimalistic approach fool you. A single Lego piece also has 
very limited functionality. 

This usage summary is written towards plugin developers, teaches how to
install plugins into the application, and how the application execution 
flows using the hook system.

## Features

ZeroMass provides two, and only two features:

- A plugin loading system
- A hook system for software component decoupling

## Plugin loading

ZeroMass is pretty minimalistic. Plugin loading follows that philosophy.
ZeroMass will look for plugins in the /plugins/ folder, relative to the
webapp public directory. It will load (require\_once) all plugins found
there.

ZeroMass will load one file per plugin. A plugin can be either composed of 
a single PHP file, or can be composed of a set of files in a directory.

### Single file plugins

Single file plugins are the simplest. They are just a single file, 
dropped in the plugins directory. ZeroMass will just require\_once the file.
If your plugin file is `com.example.plugin.php`, just drop it in 
`plugins/com.example.plugin.php`. It will be loaded.

### Multi-file plugins

A multi-file plugin isn't a lot more complicated. Instead of having a 
single-file, the plugin must be contained in a directory, and that directory
dropped in the plugins directory. ZeroMass will look for a PHP file, inside
that directory, with the same name as the directory. For example, if your 
plugin directory is

    com.example.plugin

ZeroMass will load

    com.example.plugin/com.example.plugin.php

No other file will be loaded, so the plugin must require\_once what it needs
in there. Again, reinforcing the expected behaviour, lazy-load any 
dependencies, so that plugin loading is a safe operation _under any 
circumstance_.

### Plugin format

There aren't many requirements for plugins to play nice with ZeroMass. Nevertheless, 
a couple characteristics are expected:

1. Plugins should be namespaced
2. Plugin loading must be safe as no error checking takes place during loading

It is expected that plugins be namespaced, using 
[PHP namespaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php), so ZeroMass does 
not have to deal with global namespace collisions. The 
[Java package namespacing](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html) 
style is a great method: use a domain under the author control, and name the plugin 
using the reversed domain. For example, if your plugin is named `foobar` and you own 
the domain `example.com`, name the plugin `com.example.foobar` and use the 
`com\example\foobar` PHP namespace.

It is also expected that plugin loading (require\_once of the plugin file) is safe.
Namely, no dependency checking occurs.

For example, an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) plugin may require a Database plugin for
database access. ZeroMass makes no effort towards loading the Database plugin before
the ORM plugin. Dependency handling should be done by the plugins themselves, using the 
hook system and the expected flow of events during application loading. 

In summary, when initializing your plugin, don't expect any functionality other than 
ZeroMass itself to be present. Hook the plugin to relevant events in the application 
flow, as will be explained further down. Don't set the plugin to cause an error during 
plugin loading. Plugin loading should be a completely safe operation, in any circumstance.

## Hook system

The hook system is a software component decoupling mechanism, inspired by 
[Aspect Oriented Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming).
It is composed of two methods: `ZeroMass::register_callback($tag, $callable, $priority)`
and `ZeroMass::do_callback($tag)`.

### Hook naming

Hooks are identified by their tag, the first parameter in the two functions.
Much as in package naming, to avoid collisions, the hook name must be
namespaced. Use the package name, with dots (.) instead of backslashes (\\) 
as a prefix for your hook names. If your plugin lives under the 
`com\example\foo` namespace, have all of the plugin hooks begin with 
`com.example.foo.`. Examples: `com.example.foo.bar`, `com.example.foo.init`,
etc.

### Firing hooks

Plugin developers are expected to fire `do_callback` whenever it is reasonable to expect
other plugins may be interested in knowing about application state change, or whenever it 
is reasonable to expect other plugins may be interested in manipulating data being 
processed. Let's use an example for better description:

Imagine a database plugin, in the process of performing a database connection:

    namespace com\example\db;
    class DB {
        ...
        protected function connect() {
            ...
            $dsn = $this->getDSN();
            $dsn = \ZeroMass::getInstance()->do_callback('com.example.db.dsn', $dsn);
            $this->dbHandle = new PDO($dsn);
            \ZeroMass::getInstance()->do_callback('com.example.db.connected');
            ...
        }

There are two calls to `do_callback`, exemplifying the two reasons for firing a hook. In 
the first case, the plugin is allowing other plugins to change the 
[DSN](http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php), perhaps adding authentication information
or selecting the closest database server slave, or for any other reason. This is, in fact, the
beauty of Aspect Oriented Programming. You don't need to fully specify all use cases, 
just provide hooks (Join Points in AOP parlance) where extra functionality may be added 
later on.

Note that you may pass extra parameters to `do_callback`. All parameters 
after the `$tag` will be passed to the hook handlers.

In the second case, the plugin is announcing that the database is now available. Other plugins
may then connect here to do any kind of tasks: database schema upgrades, logging, cache
refresh or, again, any kind of extra functionality not considered when writing the database plugin.

### Receiving hooks

On the other end, plugins wishing to act on the hooks fired by other plugins
register using `register_callback`. If a plugin passes parameters when 
calling `do_callback`, it is expected that handlers return the first 
parameter. If no parameters are passed, the return value is ignored.

If a hook is fired with the intent of allowing data to be changed by 
plugins, this data will be present in the first argument received by the 
hook handler. It is expected that the hook handler returns this data (be
it unchanged or after modification).

Again, let's use the database example to exemplify usage. Imagine a plugin 
responsible for connecting the webapp to the closest database slave:

    namespace com\example\db;
    class SlaveManager {
        ...
        public function __construct() {
            ...
            \ZeroMass::getInstance()->register_callback('com.example.db.dsn', array($this, 'setDSNSlave'));
            ...
        } 
        public function setDSNSlave($dsn) {
            // The DSN looks like "something;host=host_we_want_to_replace;something_else"
            preg_match('_^(.*[;:]host=)[^;]*(.*)_', $dsn, $matches);
            $preHost = $matches[1];
            $postHost = $matches[2];
            return $preHost . $this->getClosestServer() . $postHost;
        }

The above example is filtering the DSN parameter, changing the host in the
DSN.

Hooks may also be just annoucements of events, like in the following 
example:

    namespace com\example\db;
    class SchemaUpgrader {
        ... 
        public function __construct() {
            ...
            \ZeroMass::getInstance()->register_callback('com.example.db.connected', array($this, 'checkSchema'));
            ...
        } 
        public function checkSchema() {
            if ($this->readDatabaseVersion() != $this->currentDatabaseVersion) $this->upgradeDatabase();
        }

Here, the plugin hooks into the database available hook to perform upgrades to the schema if necessary. Again, note that 
the original database plugin need not take into account these extra features. It may focus on its core service
and relegate minor functionality to code written later, and placed into production only if needed.

## Basic application flow

All of this is very dandy, but how do you actually produce a page with 
ZeroMass? Unsurprisingly, you need a plugin and you need to hook up to
relevant hooks.

ZeroMass execution goes something like this:

    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Create the ZeroMass singleton                                          │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                       ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ require_once all plugins                                               │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                       ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Fire com.sergiosgc.zeromass.pluginInit                                 │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                       ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Fire com.sergiosgc.zeromass.answerPage with $handled boolean parameter │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                       ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Throw an exception if the page was not handled                         │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Now, you need a plugin, which is just a file on the `public/plugins` 
directory, named after the plugin. We'll name the plugin `com.example.hello`,
so create a file named `com.example.hello.php` with the skeleton code for 
the plugin:

    <?php
    namespace com\example\hello;
    class HelloWorld {
    }

    new HelloWorld();

This example is object-oriented, so we create a class for the plugin and 
create one instance of it. This code has no possibility of raising an error,
as per requested in this documentation.

Now, we take the constructor opportunity to hook into relevant hooks. This
is a very simple example, so we just need to hook into 
`com.sergiosgc.zeromass.answerPage`. The code becomes:

    <?php
    namespace com\example\hello;
    class HelloWorld {
        public function __construct() {
            \ZeroMass::getInstance()->register_callback(
                'com.sergiosgc.zeromass.answerPage', 
                array($this, 'hello')
            );
        }
    }

    new HelloWorld();

And now we need to add the `hello` method, otherwise ZeroMass will throw an hissy fit:

    <?php
    namespace com\example\hello;
    class HelloWorld {
        public function __construct() {
            \ZeroMass::getInstance()->register_callback(
                'com.sergiosgc.zeromass.answerPage', 
                array($this, 'hello')
            );
        }
        public function hello($answered) {
            if ($answered) return $answered;
            if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] != '/') return $answered;
    ?>
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
     <head>
      <title>Hello World</title>
     </head>
     <body>
      Hello World
     </body>
    </html>
    <?php
            return true;
        }
    }

    new HelloWorld();

`hello` produces the output, but also takes care of the `$answered` argument. 
The contract defined in the hook is that `$answered` is true if some other
plugin already answered the page. So, if it is true, `hello()` does nothing.
Then, we check the requested URI, so that we answer only the `/` URI and if
we're supposed to handle the page, produce the output and return true 
(signalling that the page request is handled).

### Proper plugin initialization

Remember that requiring the plugin must be a 100% safe operation? What 
about initialization tasks that may cause errors? 

The proper way to initialize a plugin is to use the constructor to 
hook into relevant hooks, and use the `com.sergiosgc.zeromass.pluginInit`
hook for operations that may result in errors. Continuing with the hello
world example:

    <?php
    namespace com\example\hello;
    class HelloWorld {
        public function __construct() {
            \ZeroMass::getInstance()->register_callback(
                'com.sergiosgc.zeromass.pluginInit', 
                array($this, 'init')
            );
            \ZeroMass::getInstance()->register_callback(
                'com.sergiosgc.zeromass.answerPage', 
                array($this, 'hello')
            );
        }
        public function init() {
            SomeClass::someMethodThatMayThrowAnException();
        }
        public function hello($answered) {
            if ($answered) return $answered;
            if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] != '/') return $answered;
    ?>
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
     <head>
      <title>Hello World</title>
     </head>
     <body>
      Hello World
     </body>
    </html>
    <?php
            return true;
        }
    }

    new HelloWorld();

The reason for this is to allow plugins to hook into 
`com.sergiosgc.zeromass.pluginInit.exception` and handle thrown exceptions, 
either recovering or failing gracefully.

## Webserver configuration

Webserver configuration is rather simple. The ZeroMass file list looks
like this:

    private/
    public/plugins/
    public/plugins/com.sergiosgc.zeromass.php

Move these to a proper place on your filesystem. For example, `/srv/www`.
You will now have:

    /srv/www/private/
    /srv/www/public/plugins/
    /srv/www/public/plugins/com.sergiosgc.zeromass.php

Have your webserver use `/srv/www` as its document root, directly answer any
requests for files in the filesystem, and route any requests for files
that do not exist to `/srv/www/public/plugins/com.sergiosgc.zeromass.php`
via PHP. 

The virtualhost for nginx, using php-fpm, would be:

    server {
        listen       :80;
        root   /srv/www;
    
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/index.php /zeromass/plugins/com.sergiosgc.zeromass.php?$args;
        }
    
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass   fastcgi_backend;
            fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include        fastcgi_params;
        }
    }

## Ramblings, FAQ and odd bits and pieces

### Why write ZeroMass?

My itch. I scratched it. 

It's 2012 and web development frameworks/CMSs 
(the lines blur) are a dime a dozen. I've written stuff or maintained code
in at least CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Joomla, Zend, eZPublish, Midgard and 
Drupal (damn, this list is long, meaning I'm old). I make my living around 
WordPress. All have highs and lows, and this list in particular has many
more highs than lows. However, all of them have one fault: they're 
monolithic.

Now, don't bash me. Monolithic is sometimes good. It's predictable. The more
specific problem a software package solves, the more choices will have been 
done towards solving that particular goal. CMSs are highly monolithic (try 
changing the WordPress templating system). That's ok. However, it itches me
that, for example, authentication, i have exactly one choice:

 - [Zend_Auth](http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.auth.html) if using Zend
 - [User module](http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/user) on Drupal
 - [Authentication component](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-libraries/components/authentication.html) on CakePHP
 - ...

When I'm starting a new webapp, no choices have been done, and being 
presented with pre-selected choices is:
 
 - a) a nice to have shortcut if it is an acceptable choice
 - b) a nightmare of bending frameworks out of their way if the choice does 
      not fit

Most of these packages sidestep the choice problem using plugin systems.
This solves 80% of the problems. For the rest of the cases, either 
the hook you need is missing, or there is some assumption in the basic 
design of the existing component that clashes unrecoverably with your needs.

This is not enough motivation for ZeroMass. After all, all ZeroMass does 
is start with the hook system at its core. Given enough plugins and features,
extensibility will still be a problem. Hooks will still be missing and 
architectures will still be wrong for some problems.

Then, some time ago, I read an article about the effect of GitHub on 
Open Source Software. Sorry, I can't find the link on my delicious, and 
can't find it on Google. I'll have to make a poor summary, with apologies
to the original author for the lack of referral: 

GitHub, with its popularity and with its pull requests, has changed the 
landscape of OSS. Pre-github, good OSS came from close-knit groups with 
benevolent dictators (or dictator-boards) directing development. Examples 
abound: Linux, Apache httpd, OpenOffice, PEAR, Zend, Mozilla, etc.

Post-github, OSS development became a lot more chaotic. Follow the 
developemnt of software that was born on github and take a look at pull
requests say, for example on [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pulls).
Lots and lots of small/medium improvements are done by people outside the
core developers. OSS suddenly became a lot less political and a lot more
inclusive. It is also a lot more fragmented, since the barrier to 
participation is so small, it is easy to produce __and contribute__ tiny
bits of code.

Pre-github, should you wish to add to a project, you'd have 
[formal processes](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/newmaint.proposal.php). 
Post-github, you have pull requests. It's a deal maker. Unsurprisingly
 coders like to code, they don't like politics. I once wrote [XML_RPC2](http://pear.php.net/package/XML_RPC2/)
for PEAR. It took me a week to write and [six months](http://marc.info/?l=pear-dev&m=111581594219886&w=1) to get it accepted into
PEAR. It was the last PEAR package I wrote. I don't want to be in either
end of package approval processes like PEAR's, or code approval processes
like Horde's, or OpenOffice's.

With ZeroMass distributed philosophy, I hope that, when you encounter
the situation where a plugin does not perform like you want, you can just
fork _the plugin_, fix it for your needs, and issue a pull request. Don't
get bothered with politics, and just code.

ZeroMass is the foundation for a webapp framework in a post-github world.
I will probably build enough plugins for a complete application stack. I
don't want my plugins that sit above ZeroMass to be the sole plugins
that may sit above ZeroMass. If I write an authentication plugin for 
ZeroMass, it will be __an__ auth plugin, not __the__ auth plugin. Plus,
I don't get a say in development of plugins.

Perhaps, the next time I write another webapp, I don't have to take the
choice of going with a huge framework or writing yet another _frakking_ 
login screen.

Full circle in this text: ZeroMass is an unix-philosophy approach to web 
application development, performing a very limited set of features extremely
well.

### 200 lines of code, 500 lines of documentation?

I secretly want to be a fiction writer. Rick Castle, Nikki Heat style.

### This is not new

It is not new. The plugin/hook system is heavily inspired by the [WordPress 
Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API). The ideas for software
decoupling have been around the Aspect Oriented Programming community for
eons. As far as I know, this is the first time someone starts a framework 
from the plugin system, but this may be as wrong as starting to build a 
house from the roof down.

### This is not Aspect Oriented Programming

The hook system is __inspired__ by Aspect Oriented Development. It is not
AOP by any measure. AOP usually includes a lot of stuff ZeroMass does not 
provide: 

 - Implicit Join Points, which require cooperation by the language compiler. 
   Here, all Join Points (hooks) must be explicitely declared, with the result
   that plugin developers will miss some. Let's hope plugins get forked and 
   corrected 
 - Syntactic sugar. Again, it requires either precompilation or cooperation
   by the language compiler. I'm not crazy enough to mess with Zend 
   internals. 'Been there, done that, ugly results.
 - Rich pointcut models. Proper AOP matches pointcuts at compile time.
 - Before, after and around advices. Before and after advices can be 
   simulated with explicit hooks. Around advices require the plugin firing 
   hook to expect the possibility for an around advice.

All in all, this is how close you can get to real AOP in PHP without touching
Zend internals and without ugly hacks like a precompiler.

### What now?

You've reached the end of the documentation. The final chapter. You know 
the butler did it, in the living room, with poison (a feminine murder 
weapon).

Head on over to the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).
